# IBF-system

**NOTE**: For now some background on IBF-terminology (e.g. triggers) is
expected. This can be expanded on later.

This is the repository for the IBF-system. It includes 3 main components.

1. [Trigger model development](./trigger-model-development/)

-   This contains the exploratory analysis for developing a trigger-model for a
    given country and disaster-type.
-   It might include (in the future) a lot of shared code between countries and
    disaster types, and even (automated) tools to aid analysts to develop
    trigger models.
-   The output is a `trigger script` which determines (per country/disaster
    type) when and where a trigger is reached.

2. [Services (backend)](./services/)

-   The `trigger script` is subsequently automated through (e.g. a daily
    running) service.
-   Results (as well as other related data) are stored in a database
-   Database content is returned through API-calls to some interface

3. [Interfaces (frontend)](./interfaces/)

-   Visualization of model results through dashboards
-   Dashboards might move from read-only to write-applications, where users can
    also add (secondary) data through an interface

## System design (draft)

![IBF-system design (draft)](./system-design/ibf-system-design.PNG)

## Installation 
1. Setup env variables:

    `cp example.env .env`

    Fill in the .env variables with someone who has them.

2. Whitelist your machine IP at the database server

### Using Docker

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up # for production

docker-compose up # for development

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up # for development (explicit)
```

### Without Docker (for local development)
For local development you can also run and start the services and interface without docker:

`cp .env services/API-service/.env`
`npn run start`

### Installation result 

These commands will install the IBF-system with listeners at,

1. [localhost](http://localhost) for the web server
2. \*development only - [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) for the web
   interface

## Releases

See notable changes and the currently release version in the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

### Release Checklist

This is how we create and publish a new release of the 121-platform. (See
[the glossary](#glossary) for definitions of some terms.)

-   [ ] Define the date/time of the release. (Notify the dev-team for a
        code-freeze.)
-   [ ] Define what code gets released. ("_Is the current `master`-branch
        working?_")
-   [ ] Define the `version`(-number) for the upcoming release.
-   [ ] Update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) with the date + version.
    -   [ ] Commit changes to `master`-branch on GitHub.
-   [ ] Create a `release`-branch ("`chore.release-<version>`") from current
        `master`-branch
    -   [ ] Checkout this branch locally
    -   [ ] Run `npm version patch/minor/major` at the root level to update the
            version and create the release tag
    -   [ ] Push this branch and tag to GitHub
-   [ ] "[Find the tag](https://github.com/rodekruis/IBF-system/tags)" on GitHub
    -   [ ] Edit the tag on GitHub
    -   [ ] Set the title of the release to `version`
    -   [ ] Add a short description and/or link to relevant other documents (if
            applicable)
    -   [ ] NOTE: edit the env-variables on the "staging"-server before creating
            the release, as a deploy will automatically be triggered then (see
            [Deployment](#deployment) below)
    -   [ ] Publish the release on GitHub

## Deployment

### To "test" environment

-   Merged PR's to 'master' branch are automatically deployed to the
    test-server. (via [webhook](tools/webhook.service), see:
    [/tools#GitHub-webhook](tools/README.md#github-webhook))
-   Make sure to update the environment-settings mentioned in the Changelog as
    soon as possible, preferably before the merge+deploy.

### To "staging/production" environment

-   When a release is created, it is automatically deployed to the
    staging-server.
-   Make sure to update the environment-settings mentioned in the Changelog as
    soon as possible, preferably before creating the release.

## Adding a new country

For adding a new country to the IBF-system, a lot of components are already generic, and thus automized. But also quit some manual steps are needed at the moment. This is intended to be improved in the future. The list below is intended to give a full overview. It is not however meant to be detailed enough to execute each step, without further knowledge.

1. Prepare data (look at existing countries for exact format examples + locations where to store)
    - Flood extent raster (for at least 1 return period) + an 'empty' raster of the same exten/pixel size. (.tif)
    - Population (.tif)
    - Grassland + cropland (.tif)
    - Admin-area-boundary file for agreed upon admin-level (.shp)
    - Glofas_stations_locations_with_trigger_levels_<country_code>.csv
    - Glofas_station_per_admin_area_<country_code>.csv 
        - which (e.g.) 'districts' are triggered if station X is triggered?
        - note: this should include all admin-areas. If not mapped to any station, use 'no_station'
    - vulnerability data to be used (.csv)
2. Database + scripts
    - Transfer "<country_code>_datamodel"."Indicators_TOTAL_1" from CRA To "IBF-static-input"."<country_code>_CRA_Indicators_1" using DBeaver export functionality
    - Transfer "<country_code>_datamodel"."Geo_level1" from CRA to "IBF-static-input"."<country_code>_Geo_level1" using DBeaver export functionality
    - add necessary piece of script to `processStaticDataPostgres.sql`
        - dashboard_glofas_stations
        - waterstation_per_district
        - metadata
    - add necessary piece of script to `IBF-database-scripts.sql` (for now this allows only 1 admin-level + pretend all countries are same admin-level)
        - CRA_Data_2 
        - Admin_area_data_2
3. IBF-pipeline
    - add country_code to settings.py
    - add country-specific settings to settings.py (e.g. right links to abovementioned data)
    - Run runSetup.py (`python3 runSetup.py`) for new country only (comment out other countries in settings.py)
    - Run runCron.py (`python3 runCron.py`) to test pipeline.
4. Api-Service
    - Users:
        - Add user for country to src/scripts/users.json
        - Add country to admin-user
    - Country
        - Add country in src/scripts/countries.json
    - Upload through 'npm run seed' from API-service
4. IBF-dashboard
    - Add country + parameters to country.service.ts
    - Test dashboard by logging in through admin-user or country-specific user
5. Geoserver
    - Manually create new layers in Geoserver interface (do this on server only, not locally)
        - flood_extent_<lead-time>_<country_code> for each lead-time
        - population_<country_code>
        - grassland_<country_code>
        - cropland_<country_code>
    - Test that the specifics layers are viewable in the dashboard now
    - When done, commit the (automatically) generated content in IBF-pipeline/geoserver-workspaces to Github
    - This will prevent you from having to do the same for another server, or if your content is lost somehow
6. Specifics/Extras
    - Whatsapp: 
        - create whatsapp group
        - paste link in IBF-pipeline/pipeline/lib/notifications/formatInfo.py
    - EAP-link
        - create bookmark in Google Docs at place where Trigger Model section starts
        - paste link (incl bookmark) in IBF-dashboard/src/app/services/country.service.ts
        - paste link (excl bookmark) in IBF-pipeline/pipeline/lib/notifications/formatInfo.py
    - Logo's
        - Get logo(s) (.png)
        - Paste in IBF-dashboard/app/assets/logos + add reference to each logo in  IBF-dashboard/src/app/components/logos/logos.component.ts
        - Paste in IBF-pipeline/pipeline/email-logo-<country_code>.png
    - Mailchimp segment
        - Add new tag '<country_code>' to at least 1 user
        - Create new segment '<country_code>' defined as users with tag '<country_code>'.
        - Get segmentId of new segment
        - Paste this in IBF-pipeline/pipeline/secrets.py
    - EAP-actions
        - Summarize actions from EAP-document + define 1 Area of Focus per EAP-action
        - Add to API-service/seed-data/EAP-actions.json
        - run 'npm run seed' from API-service
